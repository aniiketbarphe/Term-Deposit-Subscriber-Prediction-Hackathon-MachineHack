# Term-Deposit-Subscriber-Prediction-Hackathon-MachineHack

**1) Problem Statement:-**

This hackathon will try to address the challenges of banking telecallers when they call blindly to people in order to sell term deposit plans. The aim of this hackathon is to find the most accurate prediction of whether a person to be called will subscribe to the term deposit plan or not using any of the machine learning algorithms. The participants can use the historical data that consists of different features of customers and whether they subscribed to the plan or not. 

**2) Task:-**

Build a machine learning model to predict "Term Deposit Subcriber" for Bank

**3) Dataset:-**

**3.1) Data dimension:-** 17 features and 30,000 records. The dataset has 17 features, including 16 input features and 1 output or target feature

**3.2) Input Features:-**

a) Age: Age of the customer
b) Job: Type of job of customer
Marital: Marital status of the customer
Education: The education level of the customer
Default: Has credit in default?
Balance: Average yearly balance (in Euros)
Housing: Has a housing loan?
Loan: Has a personal loan?
Contact: Contact communication type
Day: Last contact day of the month
Month: Last contact month of the year
Duration: Last contact duration, in seconds
Campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client
Pdays: Number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (-1 means the client was not previously contacted)
Previous: Number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client
Poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign
  Output feature (Target feature)
 17 - y - Has the customer subscribed to a term deposit?

The hackathon participants need to build a machine learning based model to predict the value of the target feature (whether a customer will subscribe to the plan or not) based on the given set of input features.


Evaluation
The submission will be evaluated using the Log Loss metric. One can use sklearn.metric.log_loss to calculate the same
This hackathon supports private and public leaderboards
The public leaderboard is evaluated on 30% of Test data
The private leaderboard will be made available at the end of the hackathon, which will be evaluated on 100% Test data.
